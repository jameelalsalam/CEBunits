# CEBunits

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CEBunits is to customize use of R units package for CEB needs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CEBunits like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jameelalsalam/CEBunits")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CEBunits)
## basic example code
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
