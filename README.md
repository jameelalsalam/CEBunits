# CEBunits

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CEBunits is to customize use of R units package for CEB
needs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CEBunits like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jameelalsalam/CEBunits")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(CEBunits)
#> CEBunits package startup
## basic example code
```

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
